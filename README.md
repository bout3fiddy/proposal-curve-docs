**Proposal for the Curve DAO Grants Council**

**Objective**  
Hire two experienced technical writers, MarcoWorms and Mo, to enhance and update Curve's technical documentation.

**Need**  
The existing documentation lacks recent updates and comprehensive information on several key aspects of Curve, such as Liquidity Gauges (V4 and beyond), L2 operations, new oracles, CRVUSD/LLAMMA, CryptoSwap Exchange, Tricrypto-ng, and Curve API.

These information need to be covered in a way that makes it easy for new users to navigate Curve and onboard new technical talent.

**Proposers**

- MarcoWorms (https://github.com/MarcoWorms) has a proven record of contributing to major DeFi platforms, including writing technical documentation for Yearn. Contributions include:
  1. Yearn Docs: https://docs.yearn.finance/
  2. Github Repository: https://github.com/yearn/yearn-devdocs
- Mo (https://github.com/mo-anon), a web3 enthusiast and experienced technical writer, has developed the Couch Cushions API and Curve Lock Monitor, and begun work on new Curve documentation. Contributions include:
  1. Couch Cushions API, an API that gives unclaimed/unburnt fees across all Curve platforms: https://api-py.llama.airforce/curve/v1/protocol/couch/cushions
  2. Curve Lock Monitor: https://t.me/crvlockbot
  3. New Curve Docs: https://mo-anon.github.io/curve-mkdocs/
 
  The proposal is endorsed by fiddyresearch, who has a track record of contributing to the Curve DAO.

**Progress**  
The team is currently working with the core team on the new documentation: https://mo-anon.github.io/curve-mkdocs/

**Planning**  

1. Design Documentation hub.
2. Document Curve (as much as possible in 6 months, continue afterwards if progress is favored by the council and approved by CurveResearch).
3. Incorporate hosted jupyter notebooks to showcase how to interact with Curve. Example: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d79XDUBXNhxNX67KSlNnWADyB0_ef7tN . The example shows how to use `exchange_extended` method to avoid granting approvals to Curve contracts to execute swaps.
4. Host CurveResearch whitepapers/yellowpapers: CurveResearch is currently tasked with building out CurveSim (https://github.com/curveresearch/curvesim) and have made considerable progress re-writing Curve whitepapers into yellow papers (repository is not public but has been assessed by fiddyresearch.eth).

Documentation is not guaranteed to be completed in 6 months time.

**Documentation Management**  
The repository will be hosted on the curvefi Github, open to public contributions and updates. The docs will be accessible via docs.curve.fi.

**Budget**  
10,000 USD per month for 6 months, split evenly between MarcoWorms and Mo. Open to review and extension based on progress.

**Collaboration with CurveResearch Team**  
Upon grant approval, the team will establish a multisig with CurveResearch members. This collaboration ensures the technical accuracy and relevance of the updated documentation.
